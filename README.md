# Linked List Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the **Linked List** data structure, a fundamental building block in computer science. A Linked List is a dynamic and flexible data structure that organizes data in a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

## Features

- **Types of Linked Lists**:
  - **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
  - **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes have references to both the next and previous nodes.
  - **Circular Linked List**: The last node connects back to the first node.
- **Core Operations**:
  - Insertion: Add nodes at the beginning, middle, or end.
  - Deletion: Remove nodes from specific positions.
  - Traversal: Navigate through the nodes to access data.
  - Search: Find specific data within the list.

## Use Cases of Linked Lists

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Efficiently manage memory with variable data sizes.
- **Implement Stacks and Queues**: Form the basis for other data structures.
- **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**: Especially when working with sorted or unsorted data.
- **Real-world Applications**: Use in music playlists, navigation systems, and undo functionalities.
